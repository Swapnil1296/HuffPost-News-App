# HuffPost-News-App 🌐

**HuffPost** is an American news aggregator and blog, with localized and international editions. The site offers news, satire, blogs, and original content, and covers politics, business, entertainment, environment, technology, popular media, lifestyle, culture, comedy, healthy living, women's interests, and local news featuring columnists.[1] It was created to provide a liberal alternative to the conservative news websites such as the Drudge Report. The site offers content posted directly on the site as well as user-generated content via video blogging, audio, and photo.[6] In 2012, the website became the first commercially run United States digital media enterprise to win a Pulitzer Prize.
